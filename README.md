## Branching
Branching will be done somewhat like: [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (except omitting release branches). This means we will have **feature branches** that merge into **develop** using pull requests. Once we've reached a new milestone, it will be tagged and pushed to **master**. If something critical needs to be fixed immediately, we create a **hotfix branch** and make a pull request into master. Feature branches are prefixed "feature-", and hotfix branches are prefixed "hotfix-".
